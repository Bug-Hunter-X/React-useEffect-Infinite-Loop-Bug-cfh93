# React useEffect Infinite Loop
This example demonstrates a common React bug where an infinite loop is caused by an improper use of the useEffect hook.
The bug occurs when the state variable updated within the useEffect hook is also included in the useEffect's dependency array. This creates a cycle where the state variable keeps changing, causing the useEffect to run repeatedly and without ending, leading to an infinite loop.
